DRAPNO is a service that lets you know how you appeared in other people's dreams. It stands for DReam APpearance NOtification. 
 
It's fun to know how you show up in people's dreams: you are a night-time movie-star, making guest appearances all over town. On average, you probably appear in 3 different dreams every night. 
 
And it's fun to tell people that they've popped up in your dreams.  It's something new to tell each other.  And it's interesting to think what, if anything, it might mean.
 
DRAPNO is free and simple to use.  We hope to cover our server-costs by selling special pads for people to keep by their bed and write down their dreams before they forget them.  
 
DRAPNO is run by two friends both called Harry.  We live in London with a wife and baby (different ones). We work at a brilliant innovation company called "What If":http://www.whatifinnovation.com. We'd love to hear what you think about DRAPNO: tell us by emailing "harrys@drapno.com":mailto:harrys@drapno.com
